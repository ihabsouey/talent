# Talent Flutter Frontend

This Flutter project provides the client interface for the Talent platform. It contains only the front-end and simulates API calls.

## Getting Started

Install Flutter SDK, then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The app currently uses mock services and can connect to a Django backend later.
